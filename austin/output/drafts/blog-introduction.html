<h3>Into the web</h3>
<p>This webpage was created with the original intent of documenting the parts of
my personal life that intersect with my professional world.  I have come to a conclusion
that a work-life balance is most successful when the lines between what I choose
to do in my personal time meshes very closely to my work.</p>
<h4>A goal</h4>
<p>Effective storytelling is an exciting and valuable skill – that I struggle with.
It is exactly the opposite of the skillset I built when at school for engineering –
where I learned to create dry documents that cut sharply past the fat to the meat
of experiments and technical details of some phenomena.</p>
<p>As such, I decided to rebuild some of what I know about writing and use this website 
as a practice field.</p>
<h4>Step one</h4>
<p>There is a lot to write about without constraints.  Literally anything.  Chapter
one of <em>The Norton Field Guide to Writing</em>, gives some key questions that should be 
satisfied if I want this website to be a success.</p>
<ol>
<li>Purpose</li>
<li><em>What do you want your audience to do, think, or feel?</em></li>
<li><em>What does thisWhat does this writing task call on you to do?</em></li>
<li><em>What are the best ways to achieve your purpose?</em></li>
<li>Audience</li>
<li><em>Whom do you want to reach?</em></li>
<li><em>What is your audience's background – their education and life experiences?</em></li>
<li><em>What are their interests?</em></li>
<li><em>Is there any demographic information that you should keep in mind?</em></li>
<li><em>What political circumstances may affect their reading?</em></li>
<li><em>What does your audience already know–or believe–about your topic?</em></li>
<li><em>What's your relationship with your audience, and how does it affect your language and tone?</em></li>
<li><em>What does your audience need and expect from you?</em></li>
<li><em>What kind of response do you want?</em></li>
<li>
<p><em>How can you best appeal to your audience?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genre</p>
</li>
<li><em>What is your genre, and does it affect what content you can or should include?</em></li>
<li><em>Does your genre call for any specific strategies?</em></li>
<li><em>Does your genre require a cetrain organization?</em></li>
<li><em>Does your genre affect your tone?</em></li>
<li><em>Does the genre require formal language?</em></li>
<li><em>Do you have a choice of medium?</em></li>
<li>
<p><em>Does your genre have any design requirements?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stance</p>
</li>
<li><em>What is your stance, and how can you present it best to achieve your purpose?</em></li>
<li><em>What tone will best convey your stance?</em></li>
<li><em>How is your stance likely to be receive by your audience?</em></li>
<li>
<p><em>Should you openly reveal your stance?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Media/Design</p>
