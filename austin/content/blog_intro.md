### Into the web

This webpage was created with the original intent of documenting the parts of
my personal life that intersect with my professional world.  I have come to a conclusion
that a work-life balance is most successful when the lines between what I choose
to do in my personal time meshes very closely to my work.

#### A goal

Effective storytelling is an exciting and valuable skill – that I struggle with.
It is exactly the opposite of the skillset I built when at school for engineering –
where I learned to create dry documents that cut sharply past the fat to the meat
of experiments and technical details of some phenomena.

As such, I decided to rebuild some of what I know about writing and use this website 
as a practice field.

#### Step one
There is a lot to write about without constraints.  Literally anything.  Chapter
one of *The Norton Field Guide to Writing*, gives some key questions that should be 
satisfied if I want this website to be a success.

1. Purpose
- *What do you want your audience to do, think, or feel?*
- *What does thisWhat does this writing task call on you to do?*
- *What are the best ways to achieve your purpose?*
2. Audience
- *Whom do you want to reach?*
- *What is your audience's background – their education and life experiences?*
- *What are their interests?*
- *Is there any demographic information that you should keep in mind?*
- *What political circumstances may affect their reading?*
- *What does your audience already know–or believe–about your topic?*
- *What's your relationship with your audience, and how does it affect your language and tone?*
- *What does your audience need and expect from you?*
- *What kind of response do you want?*
- *How can you best appeal to your audience?*

3. Genre
- *What is your genre, and does it affect what content you can or should include?*
- *Does your genre call for any specific strategies?*
- *Does your genre require a cetrain organization?*
- *Does your genre affect your tone?*
- *Does the genre require formal language?*
- *Do you have a choice of medium?*
- *Does your genre have any design requirements?*

4. Stance
- *What is your stance, and how can you present it best to achieve your purpose?*
- *What tone will best convey your stance?*
- *How is your stance likely to be receive by your audience?*
- *Should you openly reveal your stance?*

5. Media/Design
