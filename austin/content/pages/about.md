#### School
Austin studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
After learning on the job for four years, he decided that it was time to go back
to learning in a structured environment.  Austin will begin work on his Master of
Science in Analytics at Georgia Tech in Fall 2018.

#### What Am I Currently Working On?
I have a few of courses that I am taking to maximise what I can get out of my 
Masters program.

###### [Calculus Single Variable Part 3 – Coursera – *University of Pennsylvania*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/integration-calculus)

I already took the calculus series through differential equations, but after 
four years of only applying concepts of calculus I decided it was time for some
remediation.  UPenn has put together this very rigorous and fast paced course
which takes a unique approach to differentiation and integration by first understanding
Series.  I would really recommend this MOOC to anyone who needs a calculus refresher
