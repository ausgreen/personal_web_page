I'm just an average dude raised in the great state of Indiana.  

In 2013 I graduated from UAB with a BSEE and spent the last four years building a broad set of skills in embedded electronics development.  

Somehow my professional path crossed with python development and I have expanded my educational interests to statistics and data science.

However, my favorite thing in the world (besides my wife) is to watch UAB basketball win.  Go blazers!
