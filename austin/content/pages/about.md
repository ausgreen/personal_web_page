### What courses are you taking to prep for your MSA?
**1. [Calculus Single Variable Part 3 – Coursera – *University of Pennsylvania*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/integration-calculus)**

I already took the calculus series through differential equations, but after 
four years of only applying concepts of calculus, it was time for some
remediation.  UPenn has put together this very rigorous and fast paced course
which takes a unique approach to differentiation and integration by first understanding
Series.  Take this course if you need a calculus refresher.

Recommended Calculus resources:

• [Course Reading](http://calculus.seas.upenn.edu/)

• [3Blue1Brown Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

2. [LAFF: Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers – EdX – UTAustinX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAustinX+UT.5.05x+1T2018/course/)

3. [Foundations of Data Analysis - Part 1 – EdX – UTAustinX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAustinX+UT.7.11x+2T2017/course/).

### What books are you studying right now?

• [Elements of Statistical Learning II](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)

• [The Norton Field Guide to Writing](https://www.google.com/search?q=+ISBN-13%20978-0393933819)

In reference to Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, etc., one of my coworkers asked me the 
question: "Why are famous and successful people always talking about the books
they have read?"

The reason seemed pretty obvious in my mind – successful and talented people are 
good at learning from and relying on others. A *good* book provides an intimate and
thorough conversation with someone who is an expert.  So, I better take advantage
and read a little bit.
