I'm just an average dude raised in the great state of Indiana.  Most of my childhood was spent building legos, eating macaroni and cheese, kicking a soccer ball, and shooting a basketball into a hoop.

Lots of things interested me as I began learning how the world operated.  The piano lessons my mom made my brother and I take, weren't one of them â€“ I can't speak for my brother, but the piano left me more than disinterested.

However, the early work that I put in on the piano started my path to music, and from music to audio engineering, and from audio engineering to a BSEE from UAB in 2013.

I have more in store for my future, lets discover some of it together.
