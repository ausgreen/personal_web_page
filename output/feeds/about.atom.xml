&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note to self: time to stop with the 3rd person narrative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What Am I Currently Working On?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few of courses that I am taking to maximise what I can get out of my 
Masters program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/integration-calculus"&gt;Calculus Single Variable Part 3 – Coursera – &lt;em&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already took the calculus series through differential equations, but after 
four years of only applying concepts of calculus I decided it was time for some
remediation.  UPenn has put together this very rigorous and fast paced course
which takes a unique approach to differentiation and integration by first understanding
Series.  I would really recommend this MOOC to anyone who needs a calculus refresher&lt;/p&gt;
